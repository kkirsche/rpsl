# RPSL - Routing Policy Specification Language

This library is a work in progress, help is greatly appreciated!

## Description
This library is a tool to allow teams to lex, parse, and build trees of RPSL objects. In the future, the hope is that this library will also support configuration generation of filters with broader support than existing tools such as Rtconfig.

This library is (or attempts to be) compliant with the following RFCs:
* [RFC 2622](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2622) - Routing Policy Specification Language
* [RFC 2650](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2650) - Using RPSL in Practice
* [RFC 2725](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2725) - Routing Policy System Security
* [RFC 4012](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4012) - Routing Policy Specification Language next generation (RPSLng)
